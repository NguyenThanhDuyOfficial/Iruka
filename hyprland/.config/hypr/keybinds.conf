## APPS
bind = SUPER, T, exec, alacritty

## WINDOW
### Use SUPER + E to send Escape to active window.
bind = SUPER, E, sendshortcut, , Escape, active

### Use SUPER + C to close active window.
bind = SUPER, C, killactive,

### Use SUPER + H/L or SUPER + [0-9] to change to next/previous or specific workspace.
bind = SUPER, H, workspace, -1 
bind = SUPER, L, workspace, +1

bind = SUPER, 1, workspace, 1
bind = SUPER, 2, workspace, 2
bind = SUPER, 3, workspace, 3
bind = SUPER, 4, workspace, 4
bind = SUPER, 5, workspace, 5
bind = SUPER, 6, workspace, 6
bind = SUPER, 7, workspace, 7
bind = SUPER, 8, workspace, 8
bind = SUPER, 9, workspace, 9
bind = SUPER, 0, workspace, 10

### Use SSUPER_SHIFT + [0-9] to move it to next/previous or specific workspace.
bind = SUPER_SHIFT, 1, movetoworkspace, 1
bind = SUPER_SHIFT, 2, movetoworkspace, 2
bind = SUPER_SHIFT, 3, movetoworkspace, 3
bind = SUPER_SHIFT, 4, movetoworkspace, 4
bind = SUPER_SHIFT, 5, movetoworkspace, 5
bind = SUPER_SHIFT, 6, movetoworkspace, 6
bind = SUPER_SHIFT, 7, movetoworkspace, 7
bind = SUPER_SHIFT, 8, movetoworkspace, 8
bind = SUPER_SHIFT, 9, movetoworkspace, 9
bind = SUPER_SHIFT, 0, movetoworkspace, 10

### Use SUPER + F or F11 to fullscreen window.
bind = SUPER, F, fullscreen, 
bind = , F11, fullscreen,

### Use CTRL + H/J/K/L or CTRL + ARROW keys to move focus in direction.
bind = SUPER_CTRL, H, movefocus, l
bind = SUPER_CTRL, J, movefocus, d
bind = SUPER_CTRL, K, movefocus, u
bind = SUPER_CTRL, L, movefocus, r

bind = SUPER_CTRL, LEFT, movefocus, l
bind = SUPER_CTRL, DOWN, movefocus, d
bind = SUPER_CTRL, UP, movefocus, u
bind = SUPER_CTRL, RIGHT, movefocus, r

### Use ALT + TAB to focus next window.
bind = ALT, TAB, cyclenext,

### Use SUPER_SHIFT + H/J/K/L or SUPER_SHIFT + ARROW keys to move the active window in the direction.
bind = SUPER_SHIFT, H, movewindow, l
bind = SUPER_SHIFT, J, movewindow, d
bind = SUPER_SHIFT, K, movewindow, u
bind = SUPER_SHIFT, L, movewindow, r

bind = SUPER_SHIFT, LEFT, movewindow, l
bind = SUPER_SHIFT, DOWN, movewindow, d
bind = SUPER_SHIFT, UP, movewindow, u
bind = SUPER_SHIFT, RIGHT, movewindow, r

### Use SUPER + P to make window picture in picture.
bind = SUPER, P, togglefloating,
bind = SUPER, P, pin,
bind = SUPER, P, resizeactive, exact 480 270
bind = SUPER, P, moveactive, exact 870 482

### Use SUPER + R to start reszize submap.
#### Which will help you resize window, change window's position.
bind = SUPER, R, submap, resize
submap = resize

#### Use H/J/K/L or ARROW keys to resize window.
binde =  , H, resizeactive, -10 0
binde =  , J, resizeactive, 0 -10
binde =  , K, resizeactive, 0 10
binde =  , L, resizeactive, 10 0

binde =  , LEFT, resizeactive, -10 0
binde =  , UP, resizeactive, 0 -10
binde =  , DOWN, resizeactive, 0 10
binde =  , RIGHT, resizeactive, 10 0

#### Use [1-4] to change window's position.
bind = , 1, moveactive, exact 16 16
bind = , 2, moveactive, exact 870 16
bind = , 3, moveactive, exact 16 482
bind = , 4, moveactive, exact 870 482

#### Use Escapse or SUPER + E to return to global submap.
bind = , Escape, submap, reset
bind = SUPER, E, submap, reset
submap = reset
